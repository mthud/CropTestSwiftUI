# CropTestSwiftUI
This is originally based on an issue with scaling and offsetting images in SwiftUI and then trying to create a final image that the user can download to their camera roll.

Uncertain whether the issue is with the Swift function or something with SwiftUI. 

The repository however also demonstrates how to use gestures and a defined frame to zoom and pan an image in the view in SwiftUI. Credit to [this video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p0SwXJYJp2U&lc=z235fxbobv3tyrhkqacdp431ulqxwnn4szljhlygnvhw03c010c.1578493841150640&feature=em-comments).
